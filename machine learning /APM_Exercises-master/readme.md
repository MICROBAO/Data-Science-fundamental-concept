Exercises for the book [Applied Predictive Modeling](http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com) by Kuhn and Johnson (2013)
--

This project contains the solutions and code for the end of chapter exercises. Included at a complied pdf and a [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) source file using LaTeX. 

Right now, the first two sets are finished and we are almost ready to post the solutions for the regression chapters.

**Note**! You may have better solutions than we have here and we would love to see them. You can do so by creating a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) or, if you are not git-savvy, drop an email to Max (<max.kuhn@pfizer.com>) and/or Kjell (<kjell@arboranalytics.com>).
