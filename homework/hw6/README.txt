Homework 6

There are two problems in this folder:

Titanic Survivor prediction:
    Titanic_Survival_Prediction.html
    Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb
    Titanic_Survival_Prediction.v3.ipynb
    titanic_test.csv
    titanic_train.csv

Data Science job classification:
    Data_Science_Job_Descriptions.html
    Data_Science_Job_Descriptions.ipynb
    Data_Science_Job_Descriptions.v3.ipynb
    predictive_modeling_data_flow.png
    JobDataFrame.tsv
    data_science_job_test.csv
    data_science_job_train.csv


For both problems, your goal is to train a classifier on the  ..._train.csv  file,
and use it to develop predictions for the  ..._test.csv  file.

For the Titanic problem, you are to predict whether each passenger Survived (1) or didn't Survive (0).
The notebook has some tutorial material and hopefully makes this pretty clear.



For the data science job classification problem, you are given a set of training examples
that contain keywords (job title keywords and descriptive tags) associated with jobs,
and a "job classification" of DS (data science) or "nonDS" (non-data science).



Please submit your predictions on Mooshak for Homework06.

ALSO:  Please submit your IPython notebooks on CCLE.
You are required to use IPython in both problems.


The Titanic notebook shows how to develop classifiers using scikit-learn.
The Data Science job notebook shows how the data was obtained from careers.stackoverflow.com.

Hints:

For the Titanic problem, a test accuracy of 75% is good, 79% is extremely good.

For the data science job classification problem, a test accuracy of 65% is good, 68% is extremely good.
